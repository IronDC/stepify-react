# What is this

Stepify is a game created by David García and Joan Carballo for the Ironhack's Module 2 Project using Node, MongoDB, Javascript and the Spotify's API.

Do you know the "Six degrees of separation" idea? It's a social theory who mantains that all people in the world are six, or fewer, social connections away from each other. ¿How many connections are between you and Donald Trump? Six or fewer. ¿How many connections are between the Spice Girls and Mozart? Stepify is a game that uses the Spotify API to address an explanations for this important question. Also for practicing web programming and for fun, but you know...

# How to play

First we decide your Initial and Final artist. Then Spotify's API gives you 20 related artist of the first one, you choose once and you get the 20 related artists, repeate and repeate until you reach the Final Artist and complete the Path.

# How it works

Stepify is a MERN stack webapp that uses the [Spotify's API](https://developer.spotify.com/) to resolve the related artist from your choosed steps.
